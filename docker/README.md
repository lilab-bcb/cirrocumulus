Example deploying cirrocumulus server, MongoDB, and [mongo-express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express) using docker-compose. 

In a production environment, we recommend using [AWS DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) instead of hosting MongoDB (and mongo-express) yourself.
